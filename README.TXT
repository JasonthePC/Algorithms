PROJECT TITLE: Algorithms
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Provide some simple methods for generating permutations.
AUTHORS: Jason Paximadas
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Write a class that uses the Permutator class. You can see how to use it in the sample tester or in the JavaDoc comments.

Permutator Class:
Creates all possible permutations of the elements in a String array of a given length.

PermutatorTester Class:
Sample code that shows how the Permutator class functions.
